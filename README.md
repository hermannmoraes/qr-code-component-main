## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I've tried my best to make the component look like that in provided design, in which I used CSS properties and some HTML tags.


### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on responsive layout in future projects.


### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - This helped me to remember how to display the page content in mobile devices using @media property.
